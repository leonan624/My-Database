SQL Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to practicing and improving SQL skills through hands-on examples.
Here, you will find scripts organized into three main categories:

DDL (Data Definition Language): Scripts for creating, altering, and managing database structures (tables, schemas, indexes, etc.).

DML (Data Manipulation Language): Examples of inserting, updating, and deleting records in different scenarios.

DQL (Data Query Language): Queries to retrieve and analyze data using SELECT statements with clauses like WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and more.

Purpose

The goal of this repository is to consolidate knowledge of SQL commands and best practices, while building a solid foundation for working with relational databases.
